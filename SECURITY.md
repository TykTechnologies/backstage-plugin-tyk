## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Tyk team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**security@tyk.io**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report (as much as you can provide):

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Disclosure Policy

- We will respond to your report within 48 hours with our evaluation and expected resolution date.
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the issue.
- We may ask for additional information or guidance during the process.
- Once the issue is resolved, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability (unless you request otherwise).
- We will credit you for the discovery in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Update Process

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported releases
4. Release new security patch versions as soon as possible

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss.
