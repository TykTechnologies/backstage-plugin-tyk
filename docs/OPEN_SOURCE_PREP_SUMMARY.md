## ✅ Completed Items

### Phase 1: Critical - Licensing & Legal

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Fix license in main plugin package.json | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Already set to AGPL-3.0 (not MPL-2.0 as checklist indicated) |
| Fix license in frontend plugin package.json | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Updated from Apache-2.0 to AGPL-3.0 |
| Review catalog-info.yaml owner field | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Uses `owner: guests` (Backstage best practice for examples) |
| Check git history for secrets | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Only localhost dev token found (safe), already replaced with env vars |
| Review dependency licenses | ✅ **COMPLETED** | All Backstage packages (Apache-2.0, compatible with AGPL-3.0) |

**Security Findings:**
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in current codebase
- ✅ All configuration uses environment variables
- ✅ .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files
- ✅ No internal Tyk URLs found
- ✅ Historical dev token (`aa509b94...`) was localhost-only and already removed

### Phase 2: Security & Sensitive Data

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Verify no hardcoded secrets | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Clean |
| Check for internal URLs | ✅ **COMPLETED** | None found |
| Review example configurations | ✅ **COMPLETED** | All use localhost/env vars appropriately |

### Phase 3: Code Quality & Package Configuration

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Main plugin package.json metadata | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Repository, author, homepage, bugs, keywords all present |
| Frontend plugin configuration | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Marked as private, @internal namespace appropriate |
| Remove NPM token requirement from docs | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Plugin README states "available as public NPM package" |

**Package Configuration Verification:**
```json
{
  "name": "@tyk-technologies/plugin-catalog-backend-module-tyk",
  "version": "0.1.13",
  "license": "AGPL-3.0",
  "author": "Tyk Technologies",
  "private": false,

  }
}
```
